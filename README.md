# GenericServletApp

This repository demonstrates the basic implementation of a `GenericServlet` in Java using Apache Tomcat and MySQL. The project is developed using the Eclipse IDE and aims to showcase how servlets can handle HTTP requests and display dynamic content in a web application.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a `GenericServlet` implementation that extends the `GenericServlet` class from the Jakarta Servlet API. The servlet responds to HTTP requests by generating dynamic HTML content. It demonstrates how servlets work by processing incoming requests and returning formatted HTML responses. In this case, the servlet outputs a simple **"Hello Generic Servlet"** message along with a link to the home page.

## Project Features

- **Servlet Implementation**: 
  The project defines a `GenericServletExample` class that overrides the `service()` method to handle requests and generate responses. It sets the response type to `text/html` and uses a `PrintWriter` to write the HTML content directly to the response stream.
  
- **Servlet Mapping**: 
  The `web.xml` deployment descriptor maps the servlet to a specific URL pattern, allowing the servlet to be invoked when the corresponding URL is accessed.

- **HTML Form Integration**: 
  The project includes an HTML file with a form that links to the servlet, demonstrating how web forms can be used to interact with servlets.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Servlets**: 
  Using the Jakarta Servlet API, the project demonstrates how to build and manage servlets.
  
- **MySQL Database**: 
  Although not deeply integrated in this example, the project structure allows for easy integration of MySQL database connection logic for storing or retrieving data.
  
- **Apache Tomcat**: 
  The project is designed to run on the Apache Tomcat server, which handles the deployment and execution of the servlet.
  
- **Eclipse IDE**: 
  Developed using Eclipse, this project is easy to modify and extend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK 11 or above is installed on your machine. [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
  
- **Apache Tomcat**: Download and set up Apache Tomcat. [Download Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
  
- **Eclipse IDE**: Download and install the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenericServletApp.git
Open the Project in Eclipse:

Launch Eclipse IDE and select the workspace where you cloned the repository.
Import the project into Eclipse by navigating to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.
Configure the Project to Run on Apache Tomcat:

Right-click on the project, go to Properties, and select Targeted Runtimes.
Check the box for the Apache Tomcat server and apply the changes.
Set Up the Database Connection (Optional):

If necessary, update your servlet code to include MySQL database connection logic.
Ensure your MySQL database is running, and create the required tables.
Deploy the Project on Tomcat:

Right-click on the project, go to Run As, and select Run on Server.
Choose the Apache Tomcat server and click Finish.
Usage
Access the Servlet:

Open your web browser and navigate to the configured URL. Typically, this will be:
http://localhost:8080/GenericServletApp/your-servlet-path
Interact with the Form:

Use the provided HTML form to send requests to the servlet and receive dynamic responses.
Project Structure
src: Contains Java source files, including GenericServletExample.java.
WebContent: Contains HTML files and the WEB-INF directory with the web.xml configuration.

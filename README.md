# GenericServletApp
This repository demonstrates the basic implementation of a GenericServlet in Java using Apache Tomcat and MySQL. The project is developed using the Eclipse IDE and aims to show how servlets can be used to handle HTTP requests and display dynamic content in a web application.
The core of this project is a GenericServlet implementation, which extends the GenericServlet class from the Jakarta Servlet API. The servlet responds to HTTP requests by generating dynamic HTML content. It demonstrates how servlets work by processing incoming requests and returning a formatted HTML response. In this case, the servlet outputs a simple "Hello Generic Servlet" message along with a link to a home page.
# GenericServletApp

This repository demonstrates the basic implementation of a GenericServlet in Java using Apache Tomcat and MySQL. The project is developed using the Eclipse IDE and aims to show how servlets can be used to handle HTTP requests and display dynamic content in a web application.

The core of this project is a GenericServlet implementation, which extends the GenericServlet class from the Jakarta Servlet API. The servlet responds to HTTP requests by generating dynamic HTML content. It demonstrates how servlets work by processing incoming requests and returning a formatted HTML response. In this case, the servlet outputs a simple "Hello Generic Servlet" message along with a link to a home page.

## Project Features

- **Servlet Implementation**: The project defines a `GenericServletExample` class that overrides the `service()` method to handle requests and generate responses. It sets the response type to `text/html` and uses a `PrintWriter` to write the HTML content directly to the response stream.
  
- **Servlet Mapping**: The `web.xml` deployment descriptor maps the servlet to a specific URL pattern, allowing the servlet to be invoked when the corresponding URL is accessed.

- **HTML Form Integration**: The project includes an HTML file with a form that links to the servlet, demonstrating how web forms can be used to interact with servlets.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Servlets**: Using the Jakarta Servlet API, the project showcases how to build and manage servlets.
  
- **MySQL Database**: Although not deeply integrated in this example, the project is structured to allow connection to a MySQL database for storing or retrieving data.
  
- **Apache Tomcat**: The project is designed to run on the Apache Tomcat server, which handles the deployment and execution of the servlet.
  
- **Eclipse IDE**: Developed in Eclipse, this project is easy to modify and extend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- **Apache Tomcat**: Download and set up Apache Tomcat from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/).

- **Eclipse IDE**: Download and install Eclipse IDE from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenericServletApp.git
Open the project in Eclipse:

Launch Eclipse IDE and select the workspace where you cloned the repository.
Import the project into Eclipse by navigating to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.
Configure the project to run on Apache Tomcat:

Right-click on the project, go to Properties, and select Targeted Runtimes.
Check the box for the Apache Tomcat server and apply the changes.
Set up the database connection:

Update your servlet code to include database connection logic as necessary.
Ensure your MySQL database is running, and create the necessary tables if your project requires them.
Deploy the project on Tomcat:

Right-click on the project, go to Run As, and select Run on Server.
Choose the Apache Tomcat server and click Finish.
Usage
Access the servlet by navigating to the configured URL in your web browser, typically: http://localhost:8080/GenericServletApp/your-servlet-path.

Interact with the HTML form to send requests to the servlet and receive dynamic responses.

Project Structure
src: Contains Java source files, including GenericServletExample.java.

# GenericServletApp
This repository demonstrates the basic implementation of a GenericServlet in Java using Apache Tomcat and MySQL. The project is developed using the Eclipse IDE and aims to show how servlets can be used to handle HTTP requests and display dynamic content in a web application.
The core of this project is a GenericServlet implementation, which extends the GenericServlet class from the Jakarta Servlet API. The servlet responds to HTTP requests by generating dynamic HTML content. It demonstrates how servlets work by processing incoming requests and returning a formatted HTML response. In this case, the servlet outputs a simple "Hello Generic Servlet" message along with a link to a home page.

Project Features:
Servlet Implementation: The project defines a GenericServletExample class that overrides the service() method to handle requests and generate responses. It sets the response type to text/html and uses a PrintWriter to write the HTML content directly to the response stream.

Servlet Mapping: The web.xml deployment descriptor maps the servlet to a specific URL pattern, allowing the servlet to be invoked when the corresponding URL is accessed.

HTML Form Integration: The project includes an HTML file with a form that links to the servlet. This demonstrates how web forms can be used to interact with servlets.

Technologies Used:
Java Servlets: Using the Jakarta Servlet API, the project showcases how to build and manage servlets.
MySQL Database: Although not deeply integrated in this example, the project is structured to allow connection to a MySQL database for storing or retrieving data.
Apache Tomcat: The project is designed to run on the Apache Tomcat server, which handles the deployment and execution of the servlet.
Eclipse IDE: Developed in Eclipse, this project is easy to modify and extend.
